# Testcontainers C & Shared Lib

This is not a standalone [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.org/) engine,
but a C-style shared library adapter for native languages like C/C++, D, Lua, Swift, etc.
It is a MVP SDK that can be later extended for the languages.

The project is based on [Testcontainers for Go](https://golang.testcontainers.org/)
which is one of the most powerful Testcontainers implementations.

## Usage in C/C++

See [the examples](./testcontaincers-c/)

## Usage in other languages

TL;DR: You get a shared library object or a DLL file from [Testcontainers for Go. C-Shared](./testcontainers-go-c-shared/),
and also C header files. Then, you know the drill.

Feel free to contribute examples or SDKs for the languages.

## Examples

- [WireMock](./demo/wiremock/)
