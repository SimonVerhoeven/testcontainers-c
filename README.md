# Testcontainers for C/C+ and other native languages

> **WARNING**: This is a prototype.

> The plan is to build a proper distributable with a CMake proper structure,

> A feasible level of feature parity with Testcontainers Go is needed too,

> Contributions are welcome!

This is not a standalone [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.org/) engine,
but a C-style shared library adapter for native languages like C/C++, D, Lua, Swift, etc.
It is a MVP SDK that can be later extended for the languages.

The project is based on [Testcontainers for Go](https://golang.testcontainers.org/)
which is one of the most powerful Testcontainers implementations.

## Sample output

This is how a very simple run without a test framework may look like.

[![Sample Output](./demo/wiremock/sample_output.png)](./demo/wiremock/)

## Documentation

Coming soon: guidelines, specs and code documentation. Check out the examples for now.

## Usage in C/C++

See [the examples and demos](./demo/)

## Usage in other languages

TL;DR: You get the C header file, a shared library object or a DLL file from the
[Testcontainers C](./testcontainers-c/) module,
Then, you know the drill.
Feel free to contribute examples or SDKs for the languages!

## Modules

- [WireMock](./modules/wiremock/)

> **NOTE:** Some modules are stored in this repository for demo and prototyping purposes.
> If you develop new modules, once `vcpkg` or `Conan` packaging is implemented for Testcontainers C,
> you might want to develop your module in a standalone repository instead.

## Examples and Demos

## Credits

Using a complex Golang framework from C/C++ is not trivial.
Neither the CMake files are.
This project would not succeed without many quality articles
and help from the community.
